To determine the service availability. You add the zip codes in Telgoo5 where you provide services, if a customer uses a zip code outside your designated service area you can block the application from further processing.\n2. Telgoo5 uses service zip codes for tax calculation. Taxes are not fixed across all the zip codes, taxes vary from county to county, city to city and zip code to zip code. That's why we require a correct zip code for accurate tax calculations.\n3. To determine the area code of the new telephone number which will assigned to the customer upon activation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n### Additional Feature:\n\nThis API also generates an enrollment ID for an order. The generated enrollment_id will be used to process order completion in other APIs which are:\n\n- [make_payment with card](api-7530808)\n- [make_payment with stripe hosted checkout](api-7533878)\n- [address_validation](api-7585045)\n- [programs_income_list](api-7609773)\n- [get_enrollments](api-7710451)\n- [eligibility_check](api-7666819)\n- [eligibility_status_check](api-7706740)\n- [plan_list](api-7731079)\n- [payment_details](api-7731259)\n- [create_lifeline_customer](api-7636604)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

You add the zip codes in Telgoo5 where you provide services, if a customer uses a zip code outside your designated service area you can block the application from further processing.\n- Telgoo5 uses service zip code for tax calculation. Taxes are not fixed across all the zip codes, taxes vary from county to county, city to city and zip code to zip code. That's why we require a correct zip code for accurate tax calculations.\n- To determine the area code of the new telphone number which will assigned to the customer upon activation.\n</Card>\n\n\n\n**The table below lists API message codes, indicating response success or failure, along with descriptions and resolution instructions.**\n| Message Code | Message | Resolution |\n|--------------|---------|------------|\n| RESTAPI000   | \"Success\" | No action needed!

        "description": "This API is used to submit the port in request for the new customers. \n\n\n:::highlight green 📌\nThis API will be used only when you created a new customer using [create_customer_prepaid_multiline](api-7530812) API and when creating a new customer you did not specify that its a PORTIN order in **activation_type** attribute.\n**activation_type** attribute in [create_customer_prepaid_multiline](api-7530812) API determines if its a new number activation or portin activation.\n\n**activation_type** attribute in [create_customer_prepaid_multiline](api-7530812) API accepts following values\n- NEWACTIVATION: If the value is NEWACTIVATION then customer will be given a new telephone number.\n\n- PORTIN: If the value is PORTIN then we will process a portin order.\n\nNow, if you do not want customer to decide if they want to port the number or want a new number during the purchase you can simply pass activation_type as NEWACTIVATION. When you do this you do not have to collect any port information upfront.\n\nAfter the customer is created and purchase is complete you can preset the options to the customer if the want to port the number or if the need a new number. \nIf the want to port the number then you can use [create_portin_v2_when_create_customer_was_called_without_portin_tag](api-7914460) API to process the port order.\n:::\n\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"First Step\">\nYou create a customer using [create_customer_prepaid_multiline](api-7530812) with **\"activation_type\" as \"NEWACTIVATION\"**\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Second Step\">\n  Then you call [create_portin_v2_when_create_customer_was_called_without_portin_tag](api-7914460) API. In this API you can send all of the port information.\n  </Step>\n      <Step title=\"Third Step\">\nUse [query_portin](api-7530925) API to check the port status. If the port is completed its all set and you can proceed to any other actions you have.\nIf there is an error/resolution required follow fifth step.          \n  </Step>\n          <Step title=\"Fourth Step\">\nUse [update_portin](api-7530927) API to update the port information and resubmit the port. After submission repeat fourth step.      \n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n\n:::tip\nIt is recommended to keep at least 10 seconds gap between the [create_portin_v2_when_create_customer_was_called_without_portin_tag](api-7914460) API and query_portin API as it could take upto that much time for the port to go over to the old carrier and respond back to us. And same thing goes with update_portin API and query_portin API.\n:::\n\n**enrollment_id** attribute in this API is a conditional. In the request you are needed to send either enrollment_id or sim.\nIn case you send both enrollment_id and sim we will give priorty to enrollment_id and will fetch the customer based on enrollment_id to activate it.\n\n**sim** attribute in this API is conditional. This is the sim that is attached to the customer's account.\nWhen you send only sim and no enrollment_id in the request we will fetch the customer on the basis of sim to activate it.\n\n**imei** attribute in this API is conditional and is needed where the carrier being used is either of the following TELGOOATT, HELIX, ATT, VERIZON, BLUECONNECTS.\n\nIn case your sim is already tagged to imei in Telgoo5 inventory you are not needed to send it.\n",
